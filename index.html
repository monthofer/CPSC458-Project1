            <p>
                I am currently finishing my final year at Chapman University pursuing a degree in Data Analytics. 
                Throughout this time I have gained the technical and interpersonal skills necessary to address and 
                solve many real-world problems creatively and effectively. Some of my interests include food, entrepreneurship, 
                existential psychology, fashion, and the many nuances of our thought. Feel free to reach out 
                if you would like to chat or think I would be a good candidate for any positions post grad!
